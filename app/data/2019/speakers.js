        'I love writing JavaScript. The trouble is, so does everyone else. When people aren`t writing JavaScript, they`re usually writing frameworks for writing JavaScript in JavaScript. In fact, most of the JavaScript that`s around these days seems to either be written for, or within, a JavaScript flavor like React, Vue, or Angular. Frameworks make writing your own code faster and more ergonomic, but they do not come without problems. Code written with Framework A depends on the environment Framework A provides in order to work — and this dependency often represents a lot of code to transmit, decompress, parse, and compile. What about "plain" JavaScript? Is it always naïve to think anything worthwhile can still be achieved just writing some straight-up code? It turns out this is a tricky question to answer, but there`s no doubt the little we do as JavaScripters is often done with much more than we need.',

      <p>Done well, open source is one of the highest-value targets for businesses these days. Companies like Facebook and Airbnb leverage OSS as a source of brand equity and recruiting, among other advantages. However, OSS is still uncomfortable for many companies — and even if they _do_ open source their tools, these projects often fail to launch — because they're missing the most important (and best) part of OSS: the community.</p>
      <p>Projects that survive in today's landscape have thriving communities that care deeply about the quality and advancement of open source _and_ the people using it. But open source can also be intimidating to newcomers, and occasionally unwelcoming. In this talk, learn how popular open source framework Gatsby has doubled down on community, including:</p>

      description: `
      <p>Are you building a rich Node.js microservices deployment? Are you integrating a frontend UI with an API backend but only find out in production that the API contract is wrong?</p>
      <p>If you are integrating your Node.js microservices into the rest of your microservices deployment then you experienced by now that classical approaches to testing systems End-to-End do not scale well for microservices due to environment complexity, slowness, and expensive setup. The other approach of mocking your dependent services provide you with no confidence while deploying. </p>
      <p>If you relate to these problems you will find it extremely beneficial to participate in this workshop and learn how to implement a Consumer-Driven Contracts pattern for a lean way of testing your microservices with the open source Pact framework to ensure APIs don’t break when different teams deploy.</p>
      <p>We’ll review the required DevOps related flows and dive to a hands-on practical Consumer and Provider testing in Node.js to to build together a couple of API services that integrate together and ship to production in a confident manner and easy to reason about testing workflows.</p>
      <p>You can expect to learn about collaborating with other team members in the workshop, build a Node.js API, test it, work in an open source GitHub project workflow where you set up Pull-Requests, and a CI pipeline all by yourself to test a system before it’s being deployed.</p>

      logo: 'angular.png',
      description: `
      <p>Reactive programming sounds scary and complicated, but in reality it’s just a very natural way of working with asynchronous data streams in your code. Observables are a representation of these streams that allow us to listen and react when new values are emitted. </p>
      <p>In the first part of the workshop we’ll take a deep dive in the world of Observables, explore the principles under which they operate, create our own, check out some common use-cases and see how they match up to Promises (the native way of handling async code in JavaScript). We’ll also have a look at the extensive and very powerful RxJS library that simplifies and enhances observables offering ways to create, transform combine and filter them. And we’ll wrap up with testing observables techniques, using ascii marble diagrams.</p>
      <p>RxJS and observables are also the backbone for the Angular framework and so for the second part of the workshop we’ll have a look at how Angular leverages the power of observables in it’s mechanisms to communicate data between components, routing, forms and http. Then we’ll look at some advanced patterns to manage complex async scenarios within an Angular application such as Observable Data Services, instant search, caching and others. For this second part of the workshop, some basic understanding of the main Angular concepts (modules, basics of creating and using components, communication, services, basic routing, basic http etc.) is needed in order to follow along with the examples.</p>
      <p>At the end of this session you will gain more confidence in programming with observables and leveraging their power in order to create truly reactive Angular (and not only) applications.</p>

      'Jumping between devops, backend and frontend development (sprinkled with unexpected gems like embedded development), with an innate curiosity for how things work behind the public API, after taking a sip of Vue.js about a year ago, I just couldn`t let it down. As I like to say, Vue.js is the framework that makes frontend development great again! So, along a few freelancing projects, I started helping people on the official Vue.js chat, learning a lot in the process - especially the hurdles someone starting with Vue.js goes through. Also, while looking for a way for people to quickly reproduce their issues, I accidentally stumbled upon CodeSandbox, and ended up contributing to it.',

      description: `
        <p>During this workshop we're gonna take a hands-on, test driven approach to implementing some best practice component patterns in Vue.js. We'll start with a few insights into how components are actually implemented in Vue.js, to get a better grasp of how they work and interact with each other. We'll continue with a short primer on how to test your components, as the hands-on part of the workshop will require you writing components that pass certain tests. We're then gonna directly tackle the patterns, which, depending on how fast we'll move and participants' interests, can be some or all of the following:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>parent <-> child communication using props and events</li>
        <li>using mixins to share common functionality between components</li>
        <li>using lazy-loading to load components only when they need to be displayed</li>
        <li>using v-model with form input components, and even with entire forms</li>
        <li>using functional components for improved rendering performance, and also to implement the popular React HOC (higher-order components) pattern</li>
        <li>using slots to customize how generalist components look like and also to manage layouts in multi-page applications</li>
        <li>using render functions instead of templates whenever we need more complex rendering logic</li>
        </ul>
        <p>At the end of the workshop participants will have a better understanding of how to leverage these patterns to create reusable components for more maintainable applications, and how to use tests to define the requirements and API of their components.</p>
